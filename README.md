# Leasing Application Backend Test

**Duration:** ~4-8 hours

**Objective:** Build a backend API to support a multi-step leasing application form.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Django** (Django Rest Framework for API)
- **Celery** (for asynchronous tasks)
- **PostgreSQL** (or SQLite for simplicity)
- **Docker** for containerization (optional)

## API Endpoints

### User Management
- **`/api/users/register/` (POST):** Register a new user.  
  Fields: username, email, password.

- **`/api/users/login/` (POST):** User login.  
  Fields: email, password.

- **`/api/users/profile/` (GET):** Retrieve user's profile details.

### Leasing Application
- **`/api/leasing/countries/` (GET):** Fetch list of countries.

- **`/api/leasing/models/` (GET):** Fetch product models based on the product type.

- **`/api/leasing/applications/` (POST):** Submit a new leasing application.

- **`/api/leasing/applications/{id}/` (GET, PUT, DELETE):** Manage existing application.

### File Management
- **`/api/files/upload/` (POST):** Upload documents.

- **`/api/files/{id}/` (GET, DELETE):** Manage uploaded documents.

## Celery Task

- **Send Confirmation Email:** Trigger a Celery task to send a confirmation email upon successful application submission.

## Features & Expectations

- JWT Authentication for secure endpoints.
- Use Django Rest Framework for API development.
- Perform validation on all data received from endpoints.
- Implement error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
- Use database transactions for application submissions to ensure data integrity.
- Asynchronous email sending with Celery.
- Dockerfile and docker-compose setup for easy deployment (optional).

## Evaluation Criteria

- Proper use of Django and Django Rest Framework features.
- Database design and query optimization.
- Celery configuration and task management.
- Code Structure and Python Best Practices.
- Security measures (e.g., authentication, input validation).
- Error handling and user-friendly messages.
- Documentation of API endpoints and how to run the project.


**React + TypeScript Test Project: Leasing Application Form**  
**Duration:** ~4-8 hours  
**Objective:** Build a multi-step leasing application form using React Hook Form. This form will be used by customers to apply for leasing products (e.g., cars, apartments, equipment).

**Tech Stack**  
- React (start with Vite or Create React App)  
- TypeScript  
- react-hook-form for form handling  
- schema validation  
- react-query or useEffect for fetching mock API data  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS / Styled Components (or plain CSS)

**Form Steps & Fields**  
**Step 1: Personal Information**  
- Full Name (required, min 3 characters)  
- Email (required, valid email format)  
- Phone (required, valid phone number)  
- Date of Birth (required, must be at least 18 years old)  
- Country (Dropdown, fetched from an API)  
**Step 2: Leasing Details**  
- Product Type (Car, Apartment, Equipment) (Dropdown)  
- Product Model (Auto-populated based on Product Type)  
- Lease Duration (1-36 months, number input, required)  
- Monthly Budget (required, min: $500)  
**Step 3: Additional Details & Submission**  
- Notes (Optional text area)  
- Upload Document (File Upload)  
- Agree to Terms & Conditions (required checkbox)  

Extra Challenge:  
- Dynamic Fields: The Product Model dropdown should be updated dynamically when Product Type changes.  
- Conditional Validation: If Lease Duration > 24 months, require Employer Name and Annual Income fields.

**Features & Expectations**  
- Multi-step Form with "Next" and "Previous" buttons  
- Validation using React Hook Form & Zod  
- Fetching Data from a Mock API  
- Save & Restore Form Data (LocalStorage or Context API)  
- Submit Data & Show Success Message  
- Clean & Reusable Component Structure  

**Evaluation Criteria**  
- React Hook Form Best Practices  
- TypeScript usage (Proper types, interfaces, etc.)  
- Performance Optimization (Avoid unnecessary re-renders)  
- Error Handling & User Experience (Form validations, error messages)  
- Code Readability & Maintainability  
- API Integration & Async Handling  

**Getting Started**  
1. Set up a React project (Vite or Create React App):  
   `npx create-react-app leasing-form --template typescript` or `npm create vite@latest leasing-form --template react-ts`  
   `cd leasing-form`  
   `npm install`  
2. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers react-query axios`  
3. Create a multi-step form using react-hook-form.  
4. Fetch mock data (countries, product models) using an API. You can use this public API:  
   `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`  
5. Implement form validation with Zod schema validation.  
6. Ensure conditional fields and dynamic dropdowns work correctly.  
7. Store form progress in LocalStorage or Context API so the user doesnâ€™t lose data when navigating between steps.  
8. Show a success message after submission.

**Submission**  
Once completed, submit the GitHub repository link with the project code and a short README explaining:  
- How to run the project  
- Any additional features implemented
