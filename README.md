**React + TypeScript Test Project: Leasing Application Form**  
**Duration:** ~4-8 hours  
**Objective:** Build a multi-step leasing application form using React Hook Form. This form will be used by customers to apply for leasing products (e.g., cars, apartments, equipment).

**Tech Stack**  
- React (start with Vite or Create React App)  
- TypeScript  
- react-hook-form for form handling  
- schema validation  
- react-query or useEffect for fetching mock API data  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS / Styled Components (or plain CSS)

**Form Steps & Fields**  
**Step 1: Personal Information**  
- Full Name (required, min 3 characters)  
- Email (required, valid email format)  
- Phone (required, valid phone number)  
- Date of Birth (required, must be at least 18 years old)  
- Country (Dropdown, fetched from an API)  
**Step 2: Leasing Details**  
- Product Type (Car, Apartment, Equipment) (Dropdown)  
- Product Model (Auto-populated based on Product Type)  
- Lease Duration (1-36 months, number input, required)  
- Monthly Budget (required, min: $500)  
**Step 3: Additional Details & Submission**  
- Notes (Optional text area)  
- Upload Document (File Upload)  
- Agree to Terms & Conditions (required checkbox)  

Extra Challenge:  
- Dynamic Fields: The Product Model dropdown should be updated dynamically when Product Type changes.  
- Conditional Validation: If Lease Duration > 24 months, require Employer Name and Annual Income fields.

**Features & Expectations**  
- Multi-step Form with "Next" and "Previous" buttons  
- Validation using React Hook Form & Zod  
- Fetching Data from a Mock API  
- Save & Restore Form Data (LocalStorage or Context API)  
- Submit Data & Show Success Message  
- Clean & Reusable Component Structure  

**Evaluation Criteria**  
- React Hook Form Best Practices  
- TypeScript usage (Proper types, interfaces, etc.)  
- Performance Optimization (Avoid unnecessary re-renders)  
- Error Handling & User Experience (Form validations, error messages)  
- Code Readability & Maintainability  
- API Integration & Async Handling  

**Getting Started**  
1. Set up a React project (Vite or Create React App):  
   `npx create-react-app leasing-form --template typescript` or `npm create vite@latest leasing-form --template react-ts`  
   `cd leasing-form`  
   `npm install`  
2. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers react-query axios`  
3. Create a multi-step form using react-hook-form.  
4. Fetch mock data (countries, product models) using an API. You can use this public API:  
   `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`  
5. Implement form validation with Zod schema validation.  
6. Ensure conditional fields and dynamic dropdowns work correctly.  
7. Store form progress in LocalStorage or Context API so the user doesnâ€™t lose data when navigating between steps.  
8. Show a success message after submission.

**Submission**  
Once completed, submit the GitHub repository link with the project code and a short README explaining:  
- How to run the project  
- Any additional features implemented
